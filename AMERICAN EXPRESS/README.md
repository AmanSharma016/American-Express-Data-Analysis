The American Express Data Analysis project is a detailed analysis of consumer transaction data in an endeavor to draw insights regarding spending behavior. The project starts with importing the dataset and conducting exploratory analyses in order to understand general structures, look for important variables such as transaction amounts, categories, and timestamps. After which, there will be a need for data cleaning and preparation steps to replace missing values and outliers to get the dataset ready for in-depth analysis. Analysis: The phase utilises Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy in dissecting the consumer behavior by breaking data by different categories, retail or dining. Matplotlib and Seaborn are a couple of the visualization tools applied to represent findings in charts and graphs. These help identify trends and trends, together with spending behavior patterns over time, culminating in completion of an in-depth report encapsulating the insights derived through such an analysis, and providing actionable recommendations to the stakeholders. Hence, this project provides deeper insights into consumer preferences, revealing the practical application of data analysis techniques, hence making it a good enhancement to a portfolio for a data analyst
